# Development

Eon owns orchestration, product configuration, component selection, updates,
and distribution. Eon Sessions owns persistent terminal state and attachment;
Eon Desktop owns native presentation and input. Yazelix Nova remains a separate
product line.

## Sources of truth

- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) — naming, ownership, and sequencing;
- [`docs/CONTRACTS.md`](CONTRACTS.md) — indexed product contracts and proofs;
- [`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`](DISTRIBUTION.md) — composition and release policy;
- [`docs/REFERENCES.md`](REFERENCES.md) — routed primary and comparable sources;
- [`docs/VISUAL-REFERENCES.md`](VISUAL-REFERENCES.md) — discovery-only visual references;
- [terminal memory benchmark](benchmarks/eon-zlf-2026-09-08.md) — the measured
  Eon, EonTerm, Foot, and Ghostty comparison; and
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) — accepted user-visible chronology.

## Checks

[`components/eon-alpha-v3.json`](../components/eon-alpha-v3.json) is the canonical
distribution-neutral component graph. Validate it with:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p eon-manifest -- components/eon-alpha-v3.json
```

Use Beads for implementation plans and deferred decisions:

```sh
bv --robot-triage
br ready
br show <id>
```

## Demo media

From the repository root, `nix run .#record-demo` records a scripted Eon
session on an isolated Wayland display. It writes the MP4 and PNG poster to
`assets/demo/`. Use ffmpeg to rebuild the animated README preview from that MP4:

```sh
ffmpeg -hide_banner -loglevel error -y -i assets/demo/eon-demo.mp4 \
  -filter_complex '[0:v]fps=12,scale=1280:-1:flags=lanczos,split[a][b];[a]palettegen=stats_mode=diff:max_colors=128[p];[b][p]paletteuse=dither=bayer:bayer_scale=5:diff_mode=rectangle' \
  -loop 0 assets/demo/eon-demo.gif
```
